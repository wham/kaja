## Task

You are porting [protoc-gen-ts](https://github.com/timostamm/protobuf-ts/tree/main/packages/plugin) to Go plugin `protoc-gen-kaja`. The Go implementation must have the exactly same output.

## Steps

1. Analyze what's already in place
2. Do additional web research how to achieve the task
3. Update [Plan](./PROMPT.md#plan) if needed.
3. Implement a piece of it
4. Run the tests
5. Capture important learnings in [Notes](./PROMPT.md/#notes)
6. Commit the changes. One line message with summary what was done.
7. If all tests passing, replace "IN-PROGRESS" in [Status](./PROMPT.md#status) with "DONE"

## Plan

- [x] Build a test harness that compares `protoc-gen-ts` and `protoc-gen-kaja` on set of sample projects
- [] TODO
