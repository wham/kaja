## Task

You are porting [protoc-gen-ts](https://github.com/timostamm/protobuf-ts/tree/main/packages/plugin) to Go plugin `protoc-gen-kaja`. The Go implementation must have the exactly same output.

## Steps

1. Analyze what's already in place
2. Do additional web research how to achieve the task. Clone the TS plugin source code and inspect.
3. Update [Plan](./PROMPT.md#plan) if needed. Be comfortable trying bigger architecture changes. Document. PROMPT.md is your memory.
3. Implement a piece of it. Spend substantial effort here.
4. Run the tests
5. Capture important learnings in [Notes](./PROMPT.md/#notes). Stuff that will make the task easier for you in the future. For example how to run the tests. How the code is structured. Don't add things that would soften the requirements - i.e. "we are close, this is cosmetic". If you see them, remove them.
6. Commit the changes. One line message with summary what was done.
7. If all tests passing, put line "DONE" at the end of PROMPT.md. No exceptions. ALL TESTS MUST PASS.

## Plan

- [x] Build a test harness that compares `protoc-gen-ts` and `protoc-gen-kaja` on set of sample projects
- [x] Implement core message/enum/service generation
- [x] Fix proto2 optional field serialization (check !== undefined)
- [x] Fix client file import ordering (types from same file maintain order)
- [x] Fix grpcbin trailing comment handling (SOLVED via SourceCodeInfo.TrailingComments)
- [x] Fix WireType import positioning in batch generation for lib files (SOLVED)
- [x] Fix client file import ordering for streaming methods (interleave vs group strategy)
- [x] Fix cross-import-path type ordering (deferred input emission)

## Notes

### Trailing Comments (SOLVED)
Proto field trailing comments (comments on the same line or after a field declaration) are extracted from `SourceCodeInfo.TrailingComments`. These are appended as ` // <comment>` on the same line as the field in the TypeScript interface. Multiline trailing comments are collapsed to a single line with spaces.

Implementation: `getTrailingComments()` function extracts the comment, and it's appended to field declarations in `generateField()`.

### Proto2 Optional Fields
Proto2 `optional` fields and proto3 explicit optional fields (`optional` keyword in proto3) must check `!== undefined` before serialization, not just compare against default values. This is implemented in `getWriteCondition()`.

### Import Ordering Strategy (SOLVED)
Client file import ordering uses two strategies depending on method types:

**Interleave Strategy** (when first non-method-0 method is streaming):
1. For each streaming method N→1: emit message types, then emit its call type (DuplexStreamingCall, etc.)
2. Then emit non-streaming method types
3. Then stackIntercept
4. Then method 0 types

**Group Strategy** (when first non-method-0 method is non-streaming):
1. Emit all non-streaming method types N→1
2. Emit all streaming call types together (Duplex, Client, Server)
3. Emit all streaming message types
4. Then stackIntercept
5. Then method 0 types

**Cross-Import-Path Type Ordering:**
When collecting non-streaming types from methods N→1:
- Emit output type first
- If input type is from same import path as output OR input == output: emit immediately
- If input type is from different import path: defer it
- When we encounter an output type from the deferred input's path: emit the deferred input immediately after
- Any remaining deferred inputs are appended at the end

This ensures types from different import paths are grouped together while maintaining method ordering within each path group.

### Format String Linter Fix
### Format String Linter Fix
Go's linter requires format strings in printf-style functions to be constants. When passing dynamic strings to `pNoIndent()`, use `"%s"` format with the string as an argument instead of passing the string directly as the format parameter.

## Status

**18/18 tests passing** (100% pass rate)

All tests passing. Output matches `protoc-gen-ts` exactly byte-for-byte.

**Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Core message/enum/service generation
- ✅ Proto2 and proto3 support
- ✅ Optional field serialization  
- ✅ Client file generation with correct import ordering
- ✅ Streaming RPC call type imports (interleave vs group strategies)
- ✅ Cross-import-path type ordering (deferred input emission)
- ✅ Well-known types, nested messages/enums, map fields, oneof, repeated fields
- ✅ Trailing field comments
- ✅ Batch generation WireType positioning
- ✅ Multiple services, cross-package imports

The implementation generates TypeScript code that matches `protoc-gen-ts` output exactly.

DONE
