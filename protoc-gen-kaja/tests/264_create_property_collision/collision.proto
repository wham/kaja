// When two fields have different proto names but collide after lowerCamelCase
// conversion, the create() method property assignment order should reflect
// JavaScript Object.entries() semantics: properties appear at the position
// where they were FIRST created, not where the LAST duplicate was assigned.
//
// Here x_1_y (field 1) and x1y (field 3) both map to localName "x1Y".
// In JS, the property "x1Y" is created at field 1's position but its value
// is overwritten by field 3. Object.entries() returns "x1Y" before "middle"
// because it was created first.
