This patch fixes blank line handling in detached comments to preserve trailing spaces.

The issue: Proto comment lines that are just whitespace (e.g., " ") should be output as "// " 
(with trailing space), not "//" (without space). This matches protoc-gen-ts behavior.

Changes needed:
1. getLeadingDetachedComments: Don't strip trailing spaces from lines (already done)
2. File-level comment output: Check if blank lines have whitespace and preserve
3. Message detached comment output: Same
4. Field detached comment output: Same  
5. Service method detached comment output: Same

The pattern in all locations:
```go
for _, line := range strings.Split(detached, "\n") {
    trimmedLine := strings.TrimSpace(line)
    if trimmedLine == "" {
        if len(line) > 0 {
            g.p("// ")  // Blank line with trailing space
        } else {
            g.p("//")   // Truly empty line
        }
    } else {
        g.p("// %s", line)
    }
}
```

Also need to handle early vs late file-level detached comments:
- Syntax/package detached comments: output BEFORE imports with `//` separators
- First message detached comments: output AFTER imports with true blank line after
